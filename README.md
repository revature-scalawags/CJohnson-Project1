# Spotify Data Analysis
A simple MapReduce application that provides functionality for aggregating data from a .CSV file containing over 170,000 song data entries, gathered from the Spotify API

## Overview
The data set includes the following fields (descriptions come of the Spotify API documentation):
> valence - A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

> year - The year in which the song was originally released.

> acousticness - A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic
